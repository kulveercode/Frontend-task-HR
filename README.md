## Here are some general tips you might consider including in your README:

## 1. Installation Instructions:

Clearly state how to install the project dependencies. You might mention running npm install or yarn install depending on your package manager.
## 2. Running the Project:

Provide instructions on how to run the project. This could include a simple command like npm start or yarn start.
## 3. Environment Variables:
If your project relies on environment variables (e.g., API keys), make sure to mention this in the README and provide guidance on how users can set them up.

## 4. Examples:
Include examples of how to use your PeopleData component in other parts of a React application. Showcasing its integration into a larger project or how it can be customized would be helpful for users.

## 5. Contributing:
If you're open to contributions, include guidelines on how others can contribute to your project.

## 6. License:
Specify the license under which your project is distributed.

Here's a template you can use as a starting point for your README:

# Project Name
Description of your project.

## Installation
npm install
or
yarn install


## Running the Project
npm startor
yarn start

## Environment Variables
If your project requires environment variables, mention them here and how to set them up.

## Examples:-
import React from 'react';
import PeopleData from './path-to-PeopleData';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Your App</h1>
      <PeopleData />
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
