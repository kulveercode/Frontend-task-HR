Here are some general tips you might consider including in your README:

Installation Instructions:

Clearly state how to install the project dependencies. You might mention running npm install or yarn install depending on your package manager.
Running the Project:

Provide instructions on how to run the project. This could include a simple command like npm start or yarn start.
Environment Variables:

If your project relies on environment variables (e.g., API keys), make sure to mention this in the README and provide guidance on how users can set them up.
Examples:

Include examples of how to use your PeopleData component in other parts of a React application. Showcasing its integration into a larger project or how it can be customized would be helpful for users.
